person_1,Social media is more harmful than good ,2,"claim present, limited support, no backing or rebuttal  Level 2","Social media can be more harmful than good if the users overuse it. It can afflict human privacy, make people distracted. First of all, many social media take the information of users for their purpose. Many researches show that the companies like Facebook, Instagram stole their users data and then the information is leaked, leading to the attacking of their users virtually. Secondly, social media is designed to capture the attention of their users, making them less focused to do the important tasks. Many studies showed that employees nowadays are less productive than before since they are always getting distracted by the notification and the urges to check things on social media. Moreover, this can affect users mental health as if they are too immersed in the virtual world, they might forget the real world they are living in, leading to disturbed view of life. ",3,"fits Level 3 well. It clearly presents a main idea (social media can be harmful if overused) with some supporting reasons, but the explanation and examples are fairly straightforward and a bit repetitive. The language is mostly simple and the structure is basic. Overall, it matches the clear but limited development expected at Level 3."
person_2,"I want to talk about the use of AI nowadays. Some people consider it bad for your study and daily life because you will be depend on it. For me, it has both pros and cons, for example, with me the use of AI like chatGPT help me a lot when i want to study something new, instead of asking it the solution, I can ask how can I find the solution, it much more better.",2,Basic claim with partial support more of subordinate claim than ground; lacks warrant and rebuttal ,"Nowadays, there are opinions that AI is bad for your daily life, there are also opinion that AI has many benefits. From my perspective, I will say that AI has both benefits and disadvantages. First, let's talk about AI disadvantages, when AI is first popular to many people in the world, there many people who just use it and didn't realize its weaknesses. For example, AI is usually incorrect, people have to research about what AI say before putting it in use, but there are many people who dont do that. Second example is that you have to worry about your personal information's security, such as your age, name, address,... when revealing it to AI because who know that somedays the AI can be hacked and your personal data is used for making bad money. Second, let's talk about AI benefits. AI benefits in many ways, you can use it for helping planning your schedule, use it for helping use solve your personal problems, or for self study. I can give some evidences about this, many people in Reddit use AI to help them schedule your daily life, how can they balance between many things such as planning how can they do their job, preparing for the date, go to the gym, eat healthy,... The second example is that, people use AI for enjoying purposes, AI can confide with them, talking like a friend, teaching them cooking. Therefore, the use of AI for me is both having its benefits and disadvantages.",4,"this essay fits Level 4 better. It discusses both pros and cons of AI with clear examples, shows some complexity in ideas, and tries to explain each point.  the arguemtn has the both sides asn comparing advantage and disadvantage with clear grounds but at the end taking one side as a claim and one as counter part

person_3,"climate change is mostly driven by man made actions like fossil fuel burning over  many years that we  have kept producing emissions like carbon monoxide, we know that this is a concerning issue and we have to find a solution for it, even though there could be natural reasons attribute to this problem like volcanic eruptions or natural life cycle activities ",3,Clear claim with multiple grounds and some acknowledgment of opposing views; warrant is implied but not fully developed,"Climate change is mostly driven by man made actions like fossil fuel burning. Over many years, we have kept producing emissions like carbon monoxide, and this has become a serious issue we need to solve. While natural factors like volcanic eruptions or cycles of nature also play a role, the bigger problem is industrial activities and big corporations. It is not just about people making small changes but it is about the massive emissions from companies and the way our whole system is built. Even if you live an eco friendly life, it wont fix the damage done by industries that keep polluting on a huge scale. To really fight climate change, we need stronger rules and real action that holds corporations responsible, not just individuals trying to reduce their carbon footprints. Working together and pushing for change at the bigger level is the only way we can make a real difference here",4,"This is Level 4 because it presents a complete two-sided argument: it acknowledges natural causes of climate change but emphasizes that human industrial activities are the main driver, and argues for systemic change beyond individual actions to effectively address the problem."
person_4," In recent years specially with the Covid outbreak people have been leaned towards the hobbies they can spend time at home. With that the lean towards anime industry has also increased. Because of the increasing demand on the shows, the mass production has started for the anime. As a result the quality has decreased and the meaning behind the stories also become shallow. ",3,Claim with some supporting reasoning and consequences; limited evidence and no clear rebuttal,"In recent years, specially with the COVID-19 pandemic when people were usually staying at home, home related hobbies has risen among most of the people like watching a TV series or cooking. Around those time also many people have discovered the anime and lean towards it. With increasing community, the demand may have also increased. The statistic data from MAL shows increase in anime production put pressure to the animators and this can reduce the quality of the animation ,the storytelling and character writing.  The pressure was mainly because of the high production leading animators to faster sketch the characters and low payment happening in many of the anime companies over the Japan. Although the increase may have caused the decrease in quality also the high competition caused the better quality shows to survive.",4,"This is Level 4 because it presents a complete argument with multiple interconnected points: the pandemic led to increased interest in anime, which raised production demand, causing animator pressure and reduced quality, but competition helped better shows prevail."
person_5,"Spending money on therapists and psychologists is not a waste of one's resources and time, rather it helps people overcome mental health issues. ",2,"Clear claim with a position, but lacks detailed reasoning, evidence, or warrant / claims and their subordinate claims WITHOUT supporting data and warrants","Spending resources and money on psychologists and therapists can be beneficial for most people, but not for everyone, as some people are quite strong-willed to overcome their mental trauma on their own and do not necessarily need a therapist. Usually, needing a therapist depends on one's mental health condition and whether or not they have already exhausted other options like seeing a Psychiatrist. On the contrary, seeing a therapist sometimes can have adverse effect's on one's life, for example the therapist might not be confidential or experienced enough to deal with your trauma\mental issues. ",4,"This argument is Level 4 because it presents a nuanced perspective, acknowledging both the benefits and limitations of therapy. It considers individual differences in mental health needs and highlights potential risks, showing complexity and balance in reasoning.

person_6,"I think AI will never be intentionally and consciously evil. Regardless of how the media and sci-fi movies suggest, AI will never get complete consciousness to act as rival to human beings. However, bad programming or training of AI may lead it to make bad or even evil decisions, but not consciously.",3,"Level 3 because it has claims + subordinate claims + data + warrants, but lacks counterarguments and rebuttals required for Level 4.","I believe that AI is not as evil as what sci-fi movies are suggesting or as much dangerous the common people are afraid of. In other words, the AI most probably doesn't have and will not have consciousness to intentionally oppose humans as a threat to human beings. Based on the Nobel winner Geoffrey Hinton's statements, the AI can be intentionally be deceptive. additionally intention in AI concept can translate to chain of thoughts based on OpenAI's recent developments and this chain of thoughts may lead to misbehavior. However, as I have also heard from a Google NLP specialist,  discussing this level of new capabilities that AI and language models have to show sympathy and higher level of humanized capabilities is more related to the  good optimization of specialist train Ai models, and has not relation with artificial intelligence having all abilities of humans. i think people should be more concerned about the privacy and ethical issues rather than the just a general exotic fear from ai ",4,"argument is Level 4 because it presents a balanced view: you acknowledge fears about AI’s potential risks while explaining why AI lacks true consciousness or intent, supported by expert opinions, and you address ethical and privacy concerns as more pressing issues."
person_7,"Playing competitive games like CS, Valorant or R6 makes me sick. I am sitting there to relax and get out of the life's difficulty but when I play that kind of games instead of relaxing I feel more anxious because of the teammates and the result of the game. But if I mostly win and play with my friends or family it sometimes feels good.",2,"Level 2 because it fits the table definition: ""claims and their subordinate claims WITHOUT supporting data and warrants."" No developed reasoning explaining WHY competitive elements cause anxiety or HOW social factors affect gaming experience + No evidence beyond personal experience","Playing multiplayer competitive games are bad for our heart pressure, stress levels and our discomfort. By increasing those it increases our anxiety as well. I remember myself playing FPS competitive games and after couple of games I felt exhausted. Study from World Health Organization  shows that people who plays 2000+ hours of competitive games increases the heart failure risk by 5% in their whole life which equal to smoking cigarettes for 5 year. For some players it can be relaxing and great time passing tool however this will be that way until they lose couple of games in serial. Another study in South Korea where the country that most competitive games most played, shows that people who play story based games instead of competitive games, it will increase their perception by 7%.  Another aspect to consider is harassment. As I came across many posts in Reddit, many female and children harassed by only their sex and age among the other players Even though they were in the leading their team it was not enough for them not to be harassed. But anyway, these online games are still considered a way that people can have fun, if we could manage the time we spent on them, sometimes they can be  good a source of entertainment for us including myself.",4,"This argument is Level 4 because it presents a complete two-sided argument, discussing both the negative health and social impacts of competitive multiplayer games and acknowledging their potential as a controlled source of entertainment, including evidence and counterpoints."
person_8,"the experiences you had as a child makes you who you are right now as an adult, it dictates your daily life. if you did not get enough love as a child, you might grow up to be a person always wanting for love, always overthinking that people might abandon you. If you read about the psychology of criminal and serial killers, to know what made them do their crimes, most of the time it leads to their bad childhood. ",2,"Level 2 because it fits the table definition: ""claims and their subordinate claims WITHOUT supporting data and warrants."" no cvidence and reason how childhood exprience creat adult patterns why this conenction supports my claim","Childhood trauma shapes the personality and daily life of an adult person. The trauma can be due to lack of parental love, bullying, sexual abuse as kid, a bad financial condition. In some cases, it can lead to making people serial killers or criminal or having bad impacts in future life as an adult that. In most of the true crime documentaries, the criminals had tough childhood due to poverty, abuse, bullying, abandonment etc. If they see their parents fighting all the time, it might make them think that this behavior is normal. There have been studies claiming that pedophilia is related to childhood abuse. However, blaming everything on childhood is a bit unfair, A person's actions also depends on people they are hanging out with, things that they think are normalized, what kind of media they are consuming and how they are perceiving it. There are many factors other than childhood trauma that can make a person do criminal activities. On the other hand, even if someone has bad childhood, they can overcome it by dealing with it through emotions, therapy and other ways so there is always a way out. If someone had a bad childhood, that does not mean that they will turn out be a bad person when they become adult. Maybe they start hating the abuse they saw or experienced as a child and might want not to do same to anyone else when they are older.",4,"argument is Level 4 because it presents a balanced, two-sided discussion: it explains how childhood trauma can shape adult behavior and contribute to criminality, but also acknowledges other influencing factors and the possibility of overcoming trauma, including counterarguments and nuanced rebuttals."
person_9,"Building a successful startup. When we talk about building a business or startup we think like it is something which is either win or loose and will either go successful or unsuccessful in one go . To me it is not something like that it is also like a career path or a job in which you gradually achieve success step by step . For startup most people think if you have got a good idea you are going to the next billionaire but it is all about how much you believe in your idea yourself ,how much you are consistent with it even if no one if believing how you plan towards building step by step  what is your validation and deployment plan and how you will manage it if it goes big .",2,"some claim and reasoning, no solid evidence or backing to be level 3 level 3 needs reason and grounds ","Successful startups are build with consistency .Building a startup is like a journey in which you succussed step by step .

person_10,I think Europe is not a good place to get rich. In order to get rich you need to migrate to US and work there. With the regulations that exist in some European countries and with high taxes for high earners most of the people end in the equal kind of living at the end but it is not like this in US based on tax levels and income levels in statistics.,3,Clear claim with grounds and partial backing but lacks detailed evidence or sources,"I think Europe is not a good place to get rich. In order to get rich you need to migrate to US and work there. With the regulations that exist in some European countries and with high taxes for high earners most of the people end in the equal kind of living at the end but it is not like this in US based on tax levels and income levels in statistics

After reading some posts, I found more reason why my argument is right. In US the salaries for same jobs are much higher than Europe. Like one post said analysts in US start at $60K but in Europe only 28K$ for same job. This big difference makes it easier to get rich in US even with higher living costs. Also the taxes in Europe are high for people who earn a lot. European countries take huge percentage from high earners so its hard to keep money you make. In US you can keep more money especially in states with no income tax.
US also has more opportunity for starting business and entrepreneurship. Like one guy said about his startup for baby products, and he made a good money with his startup but at the same time he was so concerned if Trump tariffs plan ruin his business. so the security and work life balance would be a problem in us compared to Europe.

People might say Europe has better life quality with healthcare and education based on statistics the education in us is very expensive studies shows that even the poor people can easily go to university in china or Europe but it is not possible in US for all people. If you want stable average life then maybe Europe is ok but for getting truly rich US is much better option. There was also one post about people experience moving from NL to US based on their experience they were saying that they are able to make more friends and have a better social life in US which is another advantage.",4," argument is Level 4 because you present a well-rounded, two-sided comparison of Europe and the US regarding wealth accumulation. You support your claims with specific examples like salary differences, tax policies, entrepreneurship opportunities, and social aspects, while acknowledging counterpoints about quality of life and stability in Europe. This balanced analysis demonstrates a complex understanding of the issue."
person_11,"Let's start by asking this question: what is role of AI in online platforms? just helping the big companies to boost their profits and make more money or they can also help the people to make better choice for society? For example many of big food retails compony just consider user behaviour and preference to recommend them foods with high rate o acceptance without considering the health and sustainability. These AI platforms can have a vital role in changing user behaviour and promoting more health and more sustainable decisions. Therefore, at the age of technology and the high penetrate rate of online platforms, response AI help us to have more sustainable society.",3,"Solid claim with grounds and warrant, some backing, moderate qualifier","
The previous studies have shown that AI has the potential role of creating a more sustainable society. If we use AI for good reasons, they can also help the people to make better choices. Although, this is very important area for AI, it is also very challenging and we need to do it carefully because just trying to promoting sustainable  acts can decrease the AI trust. Also, the one of main goal of Responsible AI is to strengthen communities by encouraging healthy and more sustainable life style, by this term I want to explain that the current AI that is being developed by the 'big brothers' will not necessarily helps humans to live more sustainable life for example the machine learning models that help business owners and governments to sell more fast food and earn more money by suggesting to people several colorful fast foods online, have trained more compared to the responsible AI that will help individual humans to maintain a good habit in different aspects of life.",3,argument is Level 3 because it presents a clear claim with supporting evidence and reasoning but does not address opposing views or counterarguments.
person_12,"So my argument is that, not everybody that  is graduating with a high-end science degree particularly involving healthcare education should be allowed to practice in real life settings for example a research lab, lets say a number of graduates are graduating with a degree in genetic engineering, the question are all of them eligible to handle sensitive info, practice specialized techniques, of course there will be some people will argue that everybody has a right to do so because they have a degree, i will ask that is simply an opinion, if everyone one is allowed to do everything then the quality of that particular thing comes in to question, that is the reason there are few PhDs and MDs.",4,"Clear claim, specific grounds, explicit warrant, strong backing, and effective rebuttal ","So my argument is that everyone that is graduating with a science degree, say for example like students graduating with genetic engineering should not be allowed to practice specialized techniques with sensitive info in a real life setting, just because a person has a title of bachelor of technology in biotechnology , we cant be sure that if he has good ethical standards and good amount of lab hours or if he is trained on a updated advanced curriculum that is competent enough with all the other advanced institutions. we can use standard metrics like specialized licentiate like in medicine to practice the education or to track the lab hours to create a central platform like Sweden's central admission portal , where applicants can apply and all the universities use the same portal to select the applicants. like this we can create a central system where every university having that degree program has to have an account and every student who is studying the same programm has to log their activity when in lab training, monitoring this will tell the lab hours and the license exam that is standardized to every student in the programme all over the country has to pass in order to get a license, this will improve the quality of the education and will reduce the number of ineligible graduates, statistics show that students with well enough lab hours perform well in real life settings such as research labs, one example for this is India's NEET exam helped bring down the number of unqualified students to become doctors  and simply because a person is more wealthier than the other. some people might argue that this is unfair , that everybody who has a degree is eligible but the real situation with  NEET speaks other wise.",4," argument is Level 4 because it presents a balanced view by explaining both the positive and negative impacts of technology, supports your claims with examples like cybercrime and job concerns, and acknowledges opposing perspectives such as fears about AI, while concluding with a reasoned personal stance on responsible use and regulation."

They must  consider the fact that they need to analyze different aspects of their personalities such as their ability to communicate and network, their intelligence and understanding towards the subject of the study(based on numerous studies, higher IQ results better in advanced studies),and their execrated level of work-life balance(based on surveys, people in academia feel that they have more balanced and less stressful life compared to the people in job market) in their career. To link these, people who have better communication skills can accomplish more achievements(like publishing more papers in collaboration with other researchers).Also, when it comes to higher intelligence, obviously, they can learn more when they are intelligence. In case they doubt about the above-mentioned parameters, they can start their journey and be more informative as they go through the studies. During their studies they can get a better vision toward job market vs academia comparing varying opinions there, because sometimes there are professors who are isolated in academia bubble and also there are professors that have more fair thoughts regarding the realities of job market. Knowing all these might help the pursuers to decide in the beginning of their journey and they can choose to resign at first or continue to dig deeper. Although I mentioned IQ and networking skills' significance, they might be successful with a good mentor or supervisor during their Phd and the institutional support surely plays a crucial role! a research conducted in this regard indicates the importance of self-stem and positiveness on people who want to succeed in a job.

Although C, Golang is faster languages, python also getting better. Python has large set of libraries we can use almost any use case. Even GPU programming is shifting towards python from C.

Based on many studies python has become the most popular language among many sectors like, universities and other industries. Due to the easy syntax, python is really easier to learn. Also, there are many resources in YouTube, Udemy and Coursera to study this language due to the large community. Also this is a really versatile language due to the large number of supporting libraries for almost every type of people. For example, Pytorch for AI, OpenVision for image processing, and Flower for FL. One disadvantage of python, it is not faster enough like C, Java or Go. Because it is not a compiled language. But, it is getting faster with added libraries . For example, nowadays python is using for CUDA programming embedded with C++ libraries as well. 
Hence, python is a good starting point than any other language  for any new person to start programming. Also it is really good for the job market in future.
